# ATM Simulation (Beginner Edition)

## About This Project
This is a beginner-friendly simulation of an ATM system, built using basic Python concepts like:

- Dictionaries
- Loops
- Conditions
- Try-Except
- User Input Handling  

---

## Why I Built This
- I wanted to create a practical, real-world-inspired project without copying from tutorials.
- The goal was to practice logic and dictionary management.
- I know this isn’t a real ATM—no advanced security or transaction limits yet.
- For me, this was about learning to think in code, not building a full solution (yet).

---

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/BscCanCode/atm-sim.git`  
   *(Replace with your actual repo URL if reusing, e.g., `todolist`.)*
2. Navigate to the folder: `cd atm-sim`
3. Run the script: `python atm_sim.py`  
   *(Rename your file to `atm_sim.py` if using a new file.)*

## Features (Very Basic)
|Feature|What It Does|
|-------|------------|
|Select Language|Sets language (only English supported)|
|Withdraw Cash|Withdraws money if balance and credentials match|
|Deposit Cash|Deposits money with credential verification|
|Check Balance|Displays current balance if credentials are correct|
|Exit|Closes the program|

## What can program do:
1. Select Language
2. Withdraw Cash
3. Deposit Cash
4. Check Balance
5. Exit


---

## Errors
- I’m aware there might be errors, but I’m not sure of all specifics yet. I know the initial balance is 0 (no withdrawals possible), the range check (0 < n <= 4) excludes 5, and there’s a typo ("Unauthorized INPUTS5").

## Author
- [Sid.py] ([https://github.com/BscCanCode](https://github.com/BscCanCode))

## Development Notes
- Uses basic Python (dictionaries, `try-except` for error handling).
- Known Issues:
  - I am aware of my issues in code but dont exact what issue

---

## NOTE
- This README is created with help from an AI chatbot.
- I know code has some errors, but it runs too, the reason I kept it as it is: because I want to show people what I understood and develop a code according to my understanding, as my logic and understanding will develop I may or may not update the code.

---

## Fun_Fact
- I coded this ATM simulator in a few minutes!
